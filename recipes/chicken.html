		<h3>Ingredients</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast meat - cut into chunks</li>
			<li>1/2 cup dark rum</li>
			<li>1/2 cup lemon juice</li>
			<li>1/2 cup minced garlic</li>

			<li>3 tablespoons garlic powder</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon adobo seasoning</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
			<li>2 (.18 ounce) packets sazon with coriander and achiote</li>
			<li>4 cups corn oil for frying</li>
			<li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Steps</h3>

		<ol>
			<li>
				Combine chicken, rum, lemon juice, minced garlic, Worcestershire sauce,
				garlic powder, adobo seasoning, onion powder, black pepper, coriander,
				and sazon seasoning in a large bowl; stir. Cover and allow to marinate
				in the refrigerator for 4 hours.
			</li>
			<li>
				Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat to about 300 degrees F (150
				degrees C).
			</li>
			<li>
				Spread flour into the bottom of a shallow dish. Remove chicken from
				marinade to flour in the dish; discard marinade. Toss chicken pieces
				with flour until evenly coated.

				Fry coated chicken pieces in hot oil in small batches until no longer
				pink in the center and golden brown on the outside, 5 to 10 minutes. An
				instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
				165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
