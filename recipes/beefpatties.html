		<h3>Ingredients</h3>

		<h4>Pastry</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
			<li>1 pinch salt</li>
			<li>1/4 cup butter or margarine</li>
			<li>1/4 cup shortening</li>
			<li>1/3 cup water</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Filling</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
			<li>1 pound ground beef</li>
			<li>1 small onion, finely diced</li>
			<li>1 Scotch bonnet pepper - stemmed, seeded, and minced</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon allspice</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon freshly ground back pepper</li>
			<li>1 pinch of salt</li>
			<li>1 beef bouillon cube</li>
			<li>1/2 cup water</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons browning seasoning sauce</li>
			<li>1 bay leaf</li>
			<li>1/2 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
			<li>1 egg, beaten</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Steps</h3>

		<ol>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
			<li>
				Prepare pastry: Combine flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder, and salt in
				a bowl. Cut in butter and shortening until mixture resembles coarse
				crumbs.
			</li>
			<li>Stir in water until mixture forms a ball.</li>
			<li>
				Shape dough into a log and cut it into 10 equal pieces. Roll each piece
				into a 6-inch circle (approximately 1/8-inch thick) on a lightly floured
				surface; set aside.
			</li>
			<li>
				To make the beef filling: Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat.
				Saut√© onion and diced Scotch bonnet pepper until soft, about 2 minutes.
				Stir in ground beef; season with 1 teaspoon curry powder, allspice,
				ground cloves, thyme, pepper, and salt. Cook, stirring constantly, until
				beef is evenly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Crumble in bouillon cube and
				stir in 1/2 cup of water and browning sauce until well combined; add bay
				leaf and simmer until liquid is absorbed. Remove skillet from heat;
				discard bay leaf and stir in bread crumbs.
			</li>
			<li>Spoon equal amounts of filling onto each pastry circle.</li>
			<li>
				Fold over and press edges together, making a half-circle. Use the back
				of a fork to seal edges, then brush tops with beaten egg. Place pastries
				on a baking sheet.
			</li>
			<li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.</li>
		</ol>
