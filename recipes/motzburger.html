    <h2>Who Doesn't Love Burgers?</h2>

    <p>Now lasagna is a rather simple dish consistent of ground beef, layers of pasta, tomato sauce and alot of
        mozzarella. However as simple a dish it may be, it's easily made horribly from time to time. Lucky for you I've
        got my ole' grandma's recipe that's been passed down through the family for the last 12 generations. So not only
        will your lasagna come out amazing but you can also pass down this very recipe from my family to yours.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <p>Now here's what you're gonna need:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) jar tomato sauce</li>
        <li>parsley flakes</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh parmesan</li>
        <li>1/2 pound shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 pint ricotta cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <p>Now that we've got everything we need here's how to cook it:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al
            dente; drain.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown beef and
            season with salt and pepper; drain. Stir in tomato sauce and garlic and simmer 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine mozzarella, parmesan and ricotta; stir well. In 9x13 inch pan, alternate layers of
            noodles, meat mixture and cheese mixture until pan is filled.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
