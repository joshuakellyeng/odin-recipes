    <h2>Who Doesn't Love Burgers?</h2>

    <p>Now one thing I love to eat is burgers. I make it a habit to try all the local burger joints near me. One of the
        oldest burger joints in the world is located nearby and goes by the name <strong><em>"White
                Manna"</em></strong>.
        Now this burger joint debuted at the 1939 World's Fair. So to say the least your burger skills have gotta be
        worth something if the joints remained open for the last 80 years. Any who today we're gonna learn how to make
        the perfect cheeseburger from the one the only <a

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <p>Now here's what you're gonna need:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Scooper</li>
        <li>Scrapper</li>
        <li>Smashula</li>
        <li>Buns</li>
        <li>Meat</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <p>Now that we've got everything we need here's how to cook it:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>First things first you want a skillet hot. This is a simple recipe so we can skip on some specifics. You're
            gonna butter your buns first and throw'em on the skillet till you hear em cry. Just kidding you just wanna
            toast your buns first.</li>
        <li>Next you grab your ice cream scooper and scoop some ground beef into it, plot it on your skillet and
            sprinkle a little sea salt on the top and let the bottom of the scoop brown.</li>
        <li>Now here's the magic. You wanna roll the meat ball upside down once the bottom has browned so that it's now
            facing up. Only then is when you break out the "Smashula" and <strong>SMASH</strong> almost straight down,
            but you wanna roll that spatula to the side so as to not have the patty stick to the spatula. </li>
        <li>Lastly once you see the crispy edges, your ready to flip and add the final ingredient. <em>Cheese</em>.</li>
    </ol>
