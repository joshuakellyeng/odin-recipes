    <h2>Who Doesn't Love Korean Fried Chicken</h2>

    <p>Now I don't know about you but I love to watch korean dramas and nothing hurts my soul more when there's a scene
        at a restaurant, like in one of my favorites <strong><em>"Itaewon Class"</em></strong> were the cast is chowing
        down on some delicious food and you can't join them. This little recipe will show you how to whip up some
        delicous wings so you never get that sensation of fomo ever again.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <p>Now here's what you're gonna need:</p>


    <h4>Chicken:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups canola oil for frying</li>
        <li>3 ¾ pounds chicken wings</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) jar tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup potato starch, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Sauce:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>½ cup gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)</li>
        <li>¼ cup oyster sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons mirin (Japanese sweet wine)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons grated garlic</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons white sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons black sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>



    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <p>Now that we've got everything we need here's how to cook it:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Set a rack on a foil-lined baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Pour oil into a 10-inch cast iron skillet. Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the skillet. Heat over
            medium-high heat until oil reaches 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, toss chicken, ginger, and salt together in a large bowl until evenly coated. Spread 1/2 cup
            potato starch in a shallow dish; dredge chicken to coat completely and evenly. Add remaining 1/2 cup potato
            starch as needed. Shake off excess and transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>Add chicken to the skillet carefully, working in batches; fry until lightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn
            chicken over and fry until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 175 degrees
            F (80 degrees C), 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to the rack on the prepared baking sheet. Reheat oil between
            batches to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Return chicken to the skillet in batches and fry again, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Stir gochujang, oyster sauce, mirin, ketchup, fish sauce, and garlic together in a large bowl. Add cooked
            chicken and toss to coat. Sprinkle with white and black sesame seeds.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If you're 21 or older be sure to grab some soju to pair with those wings. Drink responsibly and as the kids say
        these days "Bone Apple Teeth".</p>
